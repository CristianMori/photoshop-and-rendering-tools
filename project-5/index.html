    <h1> Kazuki Shin | CS 445: Project #5 Video Stitching and Processing</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Correspondence images and blended image. </h2>

    <h3>Final Part 1 Image</h3>

    <p> Overall, the first part was the hardest part for me. I struggled with figuring out how to exaclty match up the two frames with homography. After some trial and error, I was able to fully
    understand the computeHomography function. After this part, I just needed to put the images back into frame by transorming the 4 corners.</p>
    <h2>Part 2: Panorama From Five Key Frames</h2>
    <img src="data/2.png" alt="2">
    <p>The second part consisted mainly of applying part 1 to multiple frames. Once I conceptually fidured out how to align the frames in the correct order,
       with the middle frame as the reference point, I was able to correctly create the panorama. </p>
    <h2>Part 3: Embedded Video of Mapping to Reference Frame</h2>

    <p> THe third part took a long time to render since there were 900 frames. As I rendered from outer frames to inner frames, the panoramic video was created by overlapping towards the center point.
      Debugging was a challenege especially because the code took some time to run. The projected values were also saved as the frames were rendered. </p>
    <h2>Part 4: Panorama of Background Pixels</h2>
    <img src="data/4.png" alt="part4" width="1600">
    <p>In part four, for all pixels in the frame, I found the median value through all 900 frames and set that as the part 4 output frame value. The 0 values were ignored as part of the median calculation.</p>

    <h2>Part 5: Video of background pixels</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWqETdKfJik" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Part 5, I was able to succesfully create the background video using projections from part 3 and background panaorama from part 4.</p>

    <h2>Part 6: Video of Foreground pixels</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5KLsPzYRfbY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Part 6 was the inverse of part 5.    </p>
