      <h3>Explaination of results for Best Example</h3>
      My random function was very bad at creating the new texture as expected since there is no algorithm or <br>
      logic behind the choice of each patch. My overlapping result was alot better than random thanks to SSD,<br>
      however it is evident that many of the patches do not line up perfectly and the patches are visible. The<br>
      seam finding output image was close to perfect. The output texture looks smooth and natural thanks to the <br>
      cut function which finds the path of smallest cost. I found my particular sample to be challenging since it was a <br>
      black image with thin white lines so you could easily tell when the image did not line up. After some tweaking <br>
      of the parameters, the outputs were smooth.

      <h3>Explaination of Results</h3>
      The images above take a sample image and quilt the output using cut. The cut function maps a path with <br>
      the lowest cost so that the quilting will look the smoothest. The SSD function is able to get the most similar<br>
      patch and overlay it onto the out image.<br>

      <h2>Part IV: Texture Transfer </h2>

      <h3>Explaination of Texture Transfer</h3>
      The texture transfer works by calculating the SSD between the image patch and sample path, the SSD between <br>
      image patch and target patch then summing the two values to create an image that has the look of the target Image <br>
      but the texture of the sample image.
