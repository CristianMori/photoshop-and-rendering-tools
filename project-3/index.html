      <h3>Explaination of results for Best Example</h3>
      Poisson blending works by putting contraints on each individual pixel based off the pixel values
      of its neighbors. By getting the neighboring values from either the source or target image, the resulting
      belnded image is a smooth and naturally existing source image within the target image. To make the blending
      more natural, I focused on the coloring of the target and source image. The more different the colors were, the
      better the poisson blending was.

      <h2>Failure Example</h2>

      <img border="0"  src="data/pop.png" alt="Description: Me" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_4">
      <figcaption>^ Source Image</figcaption>
      <img border="0"  src="data/snek.png" alt="Description: Me" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_4">
      <figcaption>^ Target Image </figcaption>
      <img border="0"  src="data/snekpop_before.png" alt="Description: Me" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_4">
      <figcaption>^ blended image with the source pixels directly copied into the target region</figcaption>
      <img border="0"  src="data/snekpop_after.png" alt="Description: Me" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_4">
      <figcaption>^ final blend result</figcaption>

      <h3>Explaination of Results</h3>
      The example was my favorite image but was also the failure case bacause of the certain patches
      that did not blend in well. This occured whenever the main suject within the background image
      overlapped with the source image. Blending the border with mire complicated textures creates obvious
      spots along the blending lines, thus making it a failure case.<br>
