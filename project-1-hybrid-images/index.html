    <h2>Part I: Hybrid Images</h2>
      <h3>Favorite Hybrid Image</h3>

      <h3>Explaination of results for first image</h3>
      This hybrid imaging works by first taking two images and lining them up in a way so that it is visually appealing.
      In my case, I took a clever approach by lining up the retina of the eye to the retina of the camera lens which gave it a very cool and mesmerizing effect.
      Then you pass one image into a high pass filter and another in a low pass filter. The high pass filter gave the image a very
      textured and contrasted look, while the low pass filter gave the image a blurry look. After combining the two images, the resulting
      hybrid image looked great!

      <h3>Second Good Hybrid Image</h3>

      <h3>Explaination of results for second image</h3>
      For this pair of images, I tried to be creative by choosing two images in which the subject was posing.
      This was rather effective as the human figures of both images made it easy for the viewer to see both
      low and high pass images in the hybrid image. Overall, this set came out with very nice results.

      <h3>Bad HybridImage</h3>

      <h3>Explaination of results for third image</h3>
      I initially chose these images since both the helicopter and seal body shapes were similar.
      However, since the helicopter is so detailed and the seal had little to no contrast, it was
      almost impossible to see the seal in the hybrid image making this a failure case. Another reason
      could be because this case does not have eyes in which I could line up the images with.

    <h2>Part II: Image Enhancement</h2>
      <h3>Contrast Enhancement</h3>

        <figcaption>Increased contrast of the image by using cv2.equalizeHist(img)</figcaption>
      <h3>Color Enhancement</h3>

      <figcaption>Converted image to HSV then increased the color brightness by increasing just the saturation channel.</figcaption>

      <h3>Color Shift</h3>
